    <h2>Get to know me:</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I am Fionna Alexis, better known as Pyo. I am 21 years old from Sta.
      Mesa and I'm in my third year in Information Technology. <br />
      Initially, I opted for designing courses and projects during my second
      year, but I started taking a liking for Front-end, so here I am! <br />
      I do find it quite hard for now since I'm just starting, but I'll try my
      best to learn this field :D <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Personality wise, I am introverted and quite shy, but I am open to meeting
      new people and expanding my network! Nice to meet you!
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
    <h3>1. Video Editing</h3>
    <p>
      Vlog-like videos are my thing, though I don't post it in public, it's more
      of a memory to keep. I usually capture family events, travels, <br />
      or day-to-day activities. It takes me about 2-3 days to fully edit the
      videos. It's not of professional quality, but it is definitely fun to do
      :D
    </p>

    <h3>2. Photography</h3>
    <p>
      Also just a fun hobby of mine, I often take pictures of sceneries and
      objects that I find cute or appealing. I do take candid shots of some
      <br />
      people that I know. Although I did learn a bit about post-editing and
      photography tips from my multimedia class, I try to apply it when I can.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Learning choreos and listening to music</h3>
    <p>
      This one comes as a pair. Dancing was a favorite past time when I was
      younger, but I started getting a busy life, so I took a time off from
      it.<br />
      I normally learn Kpop choreos through mirrored videos at 0.5x speed or
      slower, and often takes me days to get it down. Music, on the other <br />
      hand, is a daily companion in my activities, whether when I'm studying,
      doing chores, or even when I'm doing nothing, it's a must <br />
      to let music flow through the room :>>
    </p>

    <h2>Interests:</h2>
    <p>
      Just to add, career-wise, I am very much still interested with UI/UX
      design, but I want to pair it with Front-end Development to bring it to
      life. <br />
      However, me and Back-end Development will definitely take a longer
      learning process, since I find it very complex hehe :P <br />

      On another note, I am also interested in learning archery and traveling
      locally and abroad - hopefully soon!!
